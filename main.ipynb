The subject will be counted for total credit requirement for completion of degree in special cases subject to recommendation of the Head and approval of concerned Academic Dean with due reasons recorded. The subject and grade will be mentioned in transcript / grade card and will be used to compute CGPA for additional subjects and will be shown as ACGPA. Failures will be marked by F grade. There will be no supplementary examination for such subjects. In the case of failure in the micro-credit subject, the student should repeat the micro-credit subject if offered in the next offered semester. The student is permitted to take alternate micro-credit subject if the subject is not offered in the next semester. (Senate Item 321.A.I.C.1). Grade revision for Micro-Credit Courses is not permitted. (Senate Item 333.C.I.C.1). However, in case the micro-credit is accepted as a subject contributing to the curricular requirement, it will be accounted for in the CGPA calculations. A student is normally not expected to take more than 2 such courses in a semester. The subject may also be a part of minor and micro‐specialization. The students can register for Micro-credit subjects with EAA as backlog (Senate Item 322.H.I.C.6). Minor in a Discipline A department would offer a MINOR in a discipline in which it offers a major. The department would enlist a set of subjects from its curriculum and prescribe a requirement for minor taking six subjects or more (18-24 contact-hours plus 3-9 hours of laboratory) from this set. The subjects would be a combination of mostly core and some electives. Students aspiring for a Minor in a discipline must register for the same in the beginning of the 5th semester. Only those students, who have a CGPA of 7.5 or above, without any Backlog, will be permitted to register for a Minor. An SGPA or CGPA in excess of 8.0 has to be maintained in the subsequent semesters without any Backlog in order to keep the Minor registration active. Should both the SGPA and CGPA fall below 8.0 at any point after registering for the minor; the Minor registration will cease to be active. A student registered for Minor in a discipline must register and pass in all subjects that constitute the requirement for a minor and score a minimum grade point average of 6.00 to be awarded a Minor in that discipline. A student may cover these six subjects as either a depth subject, elective subject or a breadth subject or as additional credits. However, he/she has to take at least three subjects as additional credits to earn a minor. Students enrolled in Dual Degree, Integrated M.Sc. and B.Arch. (Hons.) are permitted to pursue minor in other discipline up to their 10th Semester, while the students of B.Tech.(Hons.) should complete the minor requirements by 8th semester. The students can register for Minor with EAA as backlog (Senate Item 322.H.I.C.6). Micro – Specialization The Institute offers Micro-Specializations to UG students. The salient features are as follows: Each Micro-Specialization has a defined structure in terms of three sequential components: Component-I – One Foundation Course (2-4 credits) that constitutes a Mandatory Requirement and also a Pre-Requisite for subsequent Components. Component-II - One/Two subjects (3-4 credits each) from a Specified list of subjects. Component-III - Project/Design/Term Paper (4 credits) OR one subject (4 credits) from a Specified list. A Student would be required to complete 3-4 subjects (10-14 credits) from the specified list in order to earn a Micro-Specialization. The subjects can be taken through the Breadth/Open Elective component of the curriculum or as Additional Subjects. If specified in the Micro-Specialization curriculum, the subject can also be taken as Micro-Credit/s. A student has to register for a Micro-Specialization. The Registration can be done in the beginning of any Semester beyond first year. In order to register for a Micro-Specialization the student must have completed all curricular requirements upto the previous semester and have a CGPA ≥ 7.0. Thereafter the student must maintain a CGPA or SGPA ≥ 7.5 without any Backlog in the subsequent semesters to keep the Micro-Specialization registration active. GPA for the subjects contributing to the Micro-Specialization will be separately calculated. A minimum GPA of 6.00 is essential to earn the Micro-Specialization. The students can register for Micro-Specialization subjects with EAA as backlog (Senate Item 322.H.I.C.6).',\n",

      "content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so I have this question about whether someone with a CGPA of 7.3 can register for an Additional Subject. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that CGPA stands for Cumulative Grade Point Average. It's like the average grade someone has earned up to a certain point in their academic career. So if someone has a CGPA of 7.3, they're pretty high. But does that mean they can take an Additional Subject?\\n\\nI remember that some universities have specific rules about this. I think it depends on whether they're applying for undergraduate or postgraduate programs. For undergrads, I believe you need to have a CGPA of at least 4.0. So if someone has 7.3, they should be fine.\\n\\nBut wait, what about postgraduates? I'm not sure. Maybe the requirement is different there. Let me check my notes or textbooks. Oh right, for postgraduates, it might still require a CGPA of around 4.0 or higher. So even if someone is in grad school, having a CGPA of 7.3 should be okay.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is the Additional Subject requirement. I think some universities allow you to take an extra subject beyond your main degree. But again, it depends on the program. If they require a certain CGPA for that, then maybe not everyone can register. However, if the school doesn't have such a strict requirement, especially if it's a general education course, then 7.3 should be enough.\\n\\nI also wonder about the grading system. Some schools use a different scale than others. If they're using a 4-point scale, 7.3 is way above average. But if it's a 5-point scale, maybe that's still acceptable. I'm not sure how CGPA is calculated in their specific program.\\n\\nWait, another point: sometimes universities have a policy where you can take an Additional Subject only after completing your degree. So even with a high CGPA, if they don't allow it yet, you might need to wait until you finish. But the question doesn't mention that, so I think it's assuming you're applying for registration now.\\n\\nAlso, some schools might have specific rules about how many Additional Subjects you can take. If there are restrictions, then even with a high CGPA, you might not be eligible. But without knowing the specifics of the school, it's hard to say.\\n\\nIn summary, if the school allows Additional Subjects and doesn't have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0 or similar, someone with 7.3 should be able to register. However, I'm not entirely sure about all the details, so maybe I should check a few universities' websites or contact their admissions office for clarification.\\n</think>\\n\\nBased on the thought process and considerations outlined:\\n\\n- **Undergraduate Programs**: A CGPA of 7.3 is typically acceptable for undergraduate programs requiring at least a CGPA of 4.0.\\n\\n- **Postgraduate Programs**: The requirement may vary, but generally, a CGPA of around 4.0 or higher is sufficient unless specific policies apply.\\n\\n- **Additional Subject Registration**: If the school allows Additional Subjects and does not have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0, someone with a CGPA of 7.3 should be eligible.\\n\\n- **Universities-Specific Rules**: It's important to check each university's specific policy regarding CGPA for Additional Subjects and registration restrictions.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: If the school allows Additional Subjects and does not have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0, someone with a CGPA of 7.3 should be able to register. However, it's advisable to verify this directly with the target university.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'deepseek-r1:1.5b', 'created_at': '2025-02-24T15:04:38.2445254Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 14410045800, 'load_duration': 19814800, 'prompt_eval_count': 31, 'prompt_eval_duration': 25000000, 'eval_count': 772, 'eval_duration': 14362000000, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)} id='run-9be2eb14-4a6a-4705-8c75-ca2a5e468b2f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 31, 'output_tokens': 772, 'total_tokens': 803}\n"

      "content='<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the CG criteria for an interdisciplinary program. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure what that means. Let me start by breaking down the terms.\\n\\nFirst, \"CG\" probably stands for something like \"Curriculum Guidelines,\" but maybe it\\'s more specific. Interdisciplinary programs combine different fields of study, so maybe the CG needs to reflect that. I think curriculum guidelines usually outline course requirements and learning objectives. So, for an interdisciplinary program, those would need to be tailored to integrate multiple disciplines.\\n\\nI remember seeing something about academic units or departments in universities having their own guidelines. Maybe each department has its own CG criteria. That makes sense because different fields might have different expectations for what\\'s important. For example, a biology department might require more lab work and experiments, while a computer science department might focus on coding and technology.\\n\\nI should also consider how the interdisciplinary program itself is structured. It probably requires students to take courses from multiple departments or units. So, the CG criteria would need to ensure that these courses are integrated properly. Maybe there\\'s a specific number of required courses from each discipline, or perhaps some electives that allow flexibility within the interdisciplinary framework.\\n\\nAnother thing to think about is how assessments work. In an interdisciplinary program, exams might be more comprehensive since students have to demonstrate understanding across multiple subjects. The CG criteria would need to outline how these assessments are conducted and evaluated.\\n\\nI also wonder about the workload. Interdisciplinary programs can be challenging because they require balancing knowledge from different areas. So, the CG criteria might include guidelines on course load, time commitment per week or semester, and any additional responsibilities students might have outside of academics.\\n\\nMaybe there\\'s a focus on critical thinking and problem-solving skills since it\\'s interdisciplinary. The curriculum should encourage students to apply knowledge across disciplines to solve complex problems. That would mean including projects or case studies that require integrating information from various fields.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure about the specific percentages for each discipline, but I think they might be set by the academic units themselves. For example, a biology and chemistry department might allocate 40% of their curriculum to biology courses, while a computer science department could have 30%. The interdisciplinary program would then integrate these into its overall structure.\\n\\nAlso, there might be a requirement for a certain number of credit hours from each discipline. If the interdisciplinary program is 120 credit hours, maybe 48 from biology, 36 from chemistry, and 36 from computer science. That way, it\\'s balanced across all areas.\\n\\nI should also consider any specific courses or electives that are part of the interdisciplinary requirement. These might include capstone projects, research papers, or collaborative assignments where students work across disciplines.\\n\\nIn terms of learning outcomes, the CG criteria would outline what students should know and be able to do after completing the program. This includes not only knowledge from each discipline but also the ability to integrate information and apply it in new contexts.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit fuzzy on how assessments are handled. Are they based on participation, projects, exams, or a combination? The CG criteria would need to specify this so that everyone understands how student performance is evaluated.\\n\\nLastly, I think there might be a focus on developing soft skills like teamwork and communication since it\\'s an interdisciplinary program. The curriculum should encourage collaboration across different fields and present students with opportunities to work together on projects.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the CG criteria for an interdisciplinary program would likely include specific course requirements from each discipline, balanced workload, integration of knowledge across areas, critical thinking, assessments that evaluate a range of skills, and a focus on teamwork and communication. Each academic unit might have its own set of guidelines to ensure consistency and effectiveness.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe curriculum guidelines (CG) for an interdisciplinary program are structured to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines, ensuring students develop comprehensive skills. Here\\'s a concise breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Course Requirements**: Each discipline within the program must contribute a specific number of credit hours. For example, biology might account for 40%, chemistry 30%, and computer science 30%.\\n\\n2. **Workload**: The interdisciplinary program balances academic load with practical application. This may include courses that require both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience.\\n\\n3. **Assessment**: Assessments are comprehensive, evaluating understanding across disciplines through exams, projects, and case studies.\\n\\n4. **Critical Thinking and Problem Solving**: Interdisciplinary programs emphasize integrating information to solve complex problems, encouraging students to apply knowledge from various fields.\\n\\n5. **Teamwork and Communication**: The curriculum fosters collaboration, with opportunities for teamwork and communication in projects and assignments.\\n\\n6. **Learning Outcomes**: Students are expected to demonstrate a range of skills, including knowledge retention, application, and integration across disciplines.\\n\\n7. **Academic Units\\' Guidelines**: Each department may have specific CG criteria, ensuring consistency and alignment within the program structure.\\n\\nIn summary, the interdisciplinary program\\'s curriculum is designed to integrate multiple fields, balance academic load, assess comprehensive skills, and encourage teamwork and communication, all while aligning with each discipline\\'s specific requirements.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'deepseek-r1:1.5b', 'created_at': '2025-02-24T14:49:19.2148151Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 20263924000, 'load_duration': 21528900, 'prompt_eval_count': 22, 'prompt_eval_duration': 15000000, 'eval_count': 1032, 'eval_duration': 20215000000, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)} id='run-ac588e11-e62b-4258-9951-4e1c969a43fa-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 22, 'output_tokens': 1032, 'total_tokens': 1054}\n"

      "First, I should think about what I know regarding hostel food services. Typically, hostels offer different types of meals throughout the day. Maybe breakfast, lunch, dinner, and maybe even snacks in between. I remember that some hostels have a fixed menu or a rotating schedule where they serve different dishes each meal time.\n",
      "\n",

      "Another point to consider is whether the food service is consistent throughout the day.

      "The context also states that a student must maintain a CGPA of 7.5 or higher without any backlogs to be eligible. Since 7.3 is below this, they can't register for additional subjects. \n",
