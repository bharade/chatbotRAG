                "question": "Can SAPP be a continuation of the mandatory 8-week summer internship?",
                "answer": "SAPP can potentially be a continuation of the mandatory 8-week summer internship; which students undertake after the completion of the 8th semester. However, there should be no commitment from either the student or the host for clubbing the mandatory internship with SAPP at the beginning, considering the approval process uncertainties. Also, separate evaluations must be carried out for the summer internship and SAPP, with corresponding separate grade submissions."
